    "Me and a group of my friends decided to plan, write, draw, and code a video game together. When talking about my past work, they were impressed at my skill in coding, and suggested making a game together. Everyone there was instantly excited, and we started brainstorming ideas for how to write it, what it should be about, what code to use, and so on."

    "October 19th, 2018",
    "We had an official planning period, lasting almost two hours. We mostly talked about possible plot, goals of making the game, and where to build it. We've settled on a likely storyline, involving questing, thievery, and eternal summer. We're planning to build it using Unity, taking on a pixelated style in 2D (almost an overhead view, but with a slight angle to see the sides of things)."
