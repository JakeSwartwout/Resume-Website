# Resume-Website
Hello!
If you know me, welcome! Look how cool this is!
If you don't know me, hi again! My name is Jake Swartwout. There's a better intro on the website, but you're probably here to see how I did it. This is mostly on github so I can host it for free, so if you like any of my code, feel free to... take little bits of it? Be inspired? I don't know how this works.
If you're trying to see my coding skills, most of the cool functions happen in the mainCode.js file. There's also a little bit of cool stuff in the postFunctionality.js file and at the top of index.html .
