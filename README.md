# Resume-Website
Hello!

If you know me, welcome! Look how cool this is!

If you don't know me, hi again! My name is Jake Swartwout. There's a better intro on the website, but you're probably here to see how I did it. This is mostly on github so I can host it for free, but feel free to take any parts of it that you like. I built this before I really had a good understanding of javascript or program design, so I'm sure there isn't too much there. I do ocassionally update it though, so maybe eventually it'll have something good.

If you're trying to see my coding skills, please go somewhere else lol. Check out my projects list or literally just email me, this javascript is definitely not where it's at. With that out of the way, for this website the most interesting things happen in the mainCode.js file. There's also a little bit of cool stuff in the postFunctionality.js file and at the top of index.html.

To actually view the active version of the site, go to this url: https://jakeswartwout.github.io/Resume-Website/

I don't update this often, so check the github for my most recent changes or the bottom of the website for the last time I updated the posts.
