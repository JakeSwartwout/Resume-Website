                    Hi! Welcome to my website
                </p>
                <p>
                    My name is Jake Swartwout, and I'm currently a Freshman at
                    CU Boulder, in Boulder, Colorado. In 2022, I'll graduate with a
                    BS in Computer Science and a minor in Business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website is meant to act as an expanded version of a resume.
                    It will still have a copy of a traditional resume, but will
                    hopefully also give you a better idea of who I am, along with
                    showing off some of my skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to contact me at the email above. I'm currently looking
                    for a summer internship related to computer science, so if you
                    have something like that, email away! From there, I can give you my
                    official email and phone number.
                </p>
